<h1>Google Play Game Services for Android (MonkeyX module)</h1>
<p>This guide will help you, to setup the Google Play Game Services Module for MonkeyX.</p>
<p>The Play Game Services SDK provides Game services that lets you easily integrate gaming features such as achievements, leaderboards and real-time multiplayer on Android. If you haven't heard of Google Play Game Services you can get an overview <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/" title="Google Play Game Services Documentation">right here.</a></p>
<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You should have your Android development environment set up. Also please check your Android target of MonkeyX.</li>
  <li>You should have a physical device running Android 2.2 (Froyo) or higher for testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step_2_set_up_the_game_in_the_dev_console">Step 1: Set up the game in the Google Play Developer Console</h2>
<p>The Google Play Google Play Developer Console is where you manage Games services for your game, and configure metadata for authorizing and authenticating your game.</p>
<p>To set up your game in the Google Play Developer Console:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Point your web browser to the <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Google Play Developer Console</a>, and sign in.</li>
  <li>Follow these instruction to <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling#step_2_add_your_game_to_the_dev_console">add your game to the Google Play Developer Console</a>.
    <ol>
      <li>When asked if you use Google APIs in your app, select <strong>I don&rsquo;t use any Google APIs in my game yet</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you will use a game, which isn't published yet, you can change settings like name and icons later.  </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to record the following information for later:
    <ol>
      <li>Your application ID: This is a string consisting only of digits (typically 12 or more), at the beginning of your client ID.</li>
      <li>Your signing certificate: Note which certificate you used when setting up your API access (the certificate whose SHA1 fingerprint you provided). You should use the same certificate to sign your app when testing or releasing your app.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Configure achievements and/or leaderboards for your game. (Record those IDs, too)</li>
  <li>Add test accounts for your game. This step is needed only for apps that have not yet been published in the Google Play Developer Console. Before the app is published, only the test accounts listed in the Google Play Developer Console can log in. However, once an application is published, everyone is allowed to log in.</li>
  </ol>
<h2 id="step_3_modify_your_code">Step 3: Copy resources</h2>
<p>To run the module, you need to configure the application ID as a resource. Also, you have to prepare your Android target and copy various resource-files to your build dir.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the module folder - MonkeyX-Path/modules/bbd/</li>
  <li>Copy the bbd/Resources/res folder to your Android build dir. There should be an res folder already. Overwrite existing files.</li>
  <li>Open res/values/ids.xml and replace the placeholder application ID in the app_id resource.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Now you're almost done.</p>
<h2 id="step_4_test_your_game">Step 4: Add Gameservice to MonkeyX</h2>
<p>Now you can open your project and import the module.</p>
<pre>Import bbd.gameservice</pre>
<p>This example will show you, how to use the module:</p>
<pre>Import bbd.gameservices
Import mojo

Function Main()
	New MyApp
End

Class MyApp Extends App
	Field gameservice:GameService
	
	Method OnCreate()
		gameservice = New GameService				' Create GameService

		SetUpdateRate(60)
	End
	
	Method OnUpdate()
		
			If TouchHit() Then
				If gameservice.isLoggedIn() = False Then
					gameservice.beginUserSignIn()	' Log user into Game Services
				Else
					gameservice.signOut()		' Logout
				EndIf
			EndIf
		
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls()
		
		If gameservice.isLoggedIn() Then
			DrawText("Logged in!", 10, 10)
		Else
			DrawText("Tap on the screen to login to game services", 10, 10)
		EndIf
	End
	
End</pre>

<p>
  <aside class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> bbd.gameservice isn't finished yet! Please be sure and test your game before releasing it!</aside>
</p>
<h2 id="next_steps">Admob and Google Play Game Services</h2>
<p>The Admob classes are now contained within Google play Services. So if you attempt to add the Admob-6.4.1 lib (withone the Admob module from BRL does) to your project you will get dex error because of duplicate classes.</p>
<p>To get rid of them, the GameService module provides an own Admob integration, based on the BRL module of MonkeyX. Just replace the import:</p>
<pre>Import brl.admob</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre>Import bbd.gameservicesadmob</pre>
